/**
 * Own package, not common/ — "will 2+ features need this" (Section 4's
 * decision rule): currently only Order and Auth call this, so it's a
 * small dedicated domain-concern of its own, not generic cross-cutting
 * infrastructure like ApiResponse/exceptions.
 *
 * Order confirmations still just log (nothing downstream reads that
 * email yet, and there's no urgency — the order is already visible in
 * the app). Password-reset OTPs are different: the whole point is
 * getting a code to a device the caller doesn't have logged in, so
 * that one now sends a REAL email over Gmail SMTP (spring-boot-starter-mail
 * + an App Password in .env) — still free, no paid API, no vendor
 * account beyond the Gmail account already configured.
